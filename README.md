Music store created for final project of a Java WebDev class.

This is a (with the exception of monetary transactions) fully funcitonal e-commerce website where a user can register an account, browse music, and purchase any desired items.
This project remains unfinished however, work is gradually being done to fix remaining issues and bugs.
I have also included the data required to populate database tables in .csv format.
